# pancreatic_Cancer_Detection
This project creates a web application using Flask and TensorFlow to predict pancreatic cancer from medical images. Users upload an image, and the model processes it to display a prediction (Positive/Negative), accuracy score, and confusion matrix. The app also visualizes the results with Matplotlib.
